# Creepathon
## About
The Creep-a-thon is a hackathon organised by [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/) and Mozilla that asks students to consider what “creepy” personal information is available in public datasets.
### The Challenge
Using publicly-available [Venmo transaction data](https://github.com/sa7mon/venmo-data), present a story centering on data privacy using data analysis and visualisation.
### The Team
This is a collaborative project between [Sanne Albreghs](https://github.com/salbregh), [Turlough Mullan](https://github.com/tstelfox), Nick Gerrets, and Michelle Jiam.

Together we are Team Crêperie.
### The Vision
Venmo’s public API lets anyone scrap information from user transactions who have their privacy settings on public. Seeing the privacy setting is public by default, the majority of Venmo users probably doesn’t even know this information is out there for anyone to see. With our program we wan’t to show how easy it is retrieve information about a person through only their transactions, friends they send money to and the notes added to this transaction. And that this could even lead to identity theft. (edited)
