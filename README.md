# Creepathon
## About
The Creep-a-thon is a hackathon organised by [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/) and Mozilla that asks students to consider what “creepy” personal information is available in public datasets.
### The Challenge
Using publicly-available [Venmo transaction data](https://github.com/sa7mon/venmo-data), present a story centering on data privacy using data analysis and visualisation.
### The Team
This is a collaborative project between [Sanne Albreghs](https://github.com/salbregh), [Turlough Mullan](https://github.com/tstelfox), and Nick Gerrets.

Together we are Team Crêperie.
